# windowsterminalsettings
Windows Terminal Settings - since these don't sync across systems.  Linux terms before powershell.

I didn't realize how much I liked the way I was setup until I logged into a new system and realized those settings weren't there.
This will be modified in the future and is very specific to my setup at home.

In order for this to work unedited, you should have the following:
- Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Kali Linux shell
- ubuntu shell
- SuSE shell (12)

Defaults to opening ubuntu shell.
